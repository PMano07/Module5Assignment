**Introduction**  

In this assignment we are going to explore whether a customer accept the coupon? Imagine driving through town and a coupon is delivered to your cell phone for a restaurant near where you are driving. Would you accept that coupon and take a short detour to the restaurant? Would you accept the coupon but use it on a subsequent trip? Would you ignore the coupon entirely?  

**Overview**  
The goal of this project is to showcase my understandings on visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

**Deliverables**  
To explore the data I have utilized the knowledge of plotting, statistical summaries, and visualization using Python
